# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

Project overview

- Full-stack React Router (v7) application with server-side rendering (SSR) enabled.
- Built and served via Vite + @react-router/dev. Tailwind CSS is configured through the Vite plugin.
- TypeScript-first setup with generated React Router types.

Key tooling

- Bundler/dev server: Vite (vite.config.ts)
- Router/dev tooling: @react-router/dev (react-router build/dev/typegen), SSR enabled in react-router.config.ts
- Styling: Tailwind CSS via @tailwindcss/vite; global styles in app/app.css
- TypeScript config: ES2022 modules, bundler resolution, alias ~/_ -> app/_, includes .react-router/types for typegen

Commands

- Install dependencies (npm is the package manager in use):
  - Reproducible install: npm ci
  - Standard install: npm install
- Development (HMR + SSR):
  - npm run dev
  - Defaults to http://localhost:5173/
- Build for production:
  - npm run build
  - Output: build/client (static assets) and build/server (server bundle)
- Serve production build (Node server):
  - npm start
  - This runs react-router-serve ./build/server/index.js
- Type checking and route type generation:
  - npm run typecheck (react-router typegen && tsc)

Formatting & linting

- Code formatting: npm run format (writes changes) and npm run format:check (verifies formatting).
- Note: No test or ESLint configs are currently defined. If you add testing or linting, include scripts and configs so future agents can run them.

Docker (from README)

- Build image: docker build -t ai-resume-analyser .
- Run container: docker run -p 3000:3000 ai-resume-analyser
- The container runs npm start, serving the built SSR app on port 3000.

Architecture and structure

- Vite + React Router SSR:
  - SSR is enabled (react-router.config.ts: ssr: true). Production start uses the server bundle at build/server/index.js.
  - Vite config adds three plugins: Tailwind, reactRouter, and tsconfigPaths (vite-tsconfig-paths).
- Routing:
  - File-based configuration lives in app/routes.ts using @react-router/dev/routes. The index route maps to app/routes/home.tsx.
  - Route modules use generated types (e.g., ./+types/home). Root types live at ./+types/root and are generated by react-router typegen.
- Root layout and document:
  - app/root.tsx defines the HTML document (Links, Meta, Scripts, ScrollRestoration) and Layout wrapper. It also provides an ErrorBoundary for both 404 and runtime errors.
- Styling and assets:
  - Tailwind CSS classes are used in components (see ErrorBoundary). Fonts are preconnected and loaded via <Links> in root.tsx. Global CSS lives in app/app.css.
- TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json):
  - ES2022 target/module, bundler moduleResolution, strict mode enabled.
  - Paths alias: ~/_ resolves to app/_, and .react-router/types is included for route type generation.

Notable files

- vite.config.ts: Configures Tailwind, React Router dev, and tsconfig path aliases.
- react-router.config.ts: Sets ssr: true (switch to false for SPA-only).
- app/root.tsx: Document shell, layout, global links/meta, error boundary, outlet.
- app/routes.ts: Route config (index route -> routes/home.tsx).

External docs reflected here (from README)

- Dev server runs at http://localhost:5173/ (via npm run dev).
- Production build artifacts are under build/ (client and server subdirs).
- Docker-based deployment is supported via the included Dockerfile.
